# SORA & HUE CONTENT STRATEGY
## Attract NYC Remodelers with High-Converting Content

---

## YOUR CORE POSITIONING

**Who You Serve:** NYC remodelers and contractors (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx)

**What You Deliver:** Websites that don't just look good—they book jobs

**Your Unique Angle:** You understand builders. You speak their language. You solve their real problems (not being found, not converting visitors, looking unprofessional online).

---

## THE 3-PILLAR CONTENT FRAMEWORK

### PILLAR 1: BETTER THAN EVERYONE (40% of content)
**Your One Thing:** Strategic design thinking for remodelers

**Post Ideas:**

**Monday Authority Post:**
```
Hook: "Most designers make websites pretty. I make them profitable."

Body:
Here's the difference:

Pretty websites focus on:
• Trendy fonts
• Fancy animations  
• Award-worthy design

Profitable websites focus on:
• Clear value proposition
• Obvious next step
• Trust signals everywhere

I've tested both. Profit wins every time.

My client in Queens? His "pretty" site got 50 visitors/month, 0 calls.

We rebuilt it focusing on conversion. Same traffic. 12 calls first month.

Your website isn't a portfolio. It's your 24/7 salesperson.

---
Want a site that books jobs? Link in bio.
```

**Wednesday Contrarian Take:**
```
Hook: "Unpopular opinion: Your website doesn't need more pages."

Body:
It needs better pages.

Most remodelers think:
"More services = more clients"

So they add:
• Kitchen remodeling page
• Bathroom renovation page  
• Basement finishing page
• Deck building page
• Home additions page
• Full gut renovations page

Then wonder why no one calls.

Here's the truth: Homeowners don't buy pages. They buy clarity.

One well-designed service page with clear benefits > 10 mediocre pages

Quality > quantity. Always.

---
Need help simplifying? Comment "CLEAR"
```

### PILLAR 2: QUICK WINS (40% of content)
**24-Hour Rule:** Can they implement within 24 hours?

**Tuesday Quick Fix:**
```
Hook: "5-minute fix that doubled a remodeler's calls"

Body:
Go to your homepage right now.

Find your main button.

Does it say "Contact Us"?

Change it to "Book Free Estimate"

That's it. 5 minutes. Done.

Why this works:
• "Contact Us" = vague (what happens next?)
• "Book Free Estimate" = clear outcome

Brooklyn contractor made this change. Calls went from 3/month to 7/month.

Same traffic. Better clarity.

---
Made the change? Drop ✅ below
```

**Thursday Copy-Paste Resource:**
```
Hook: "Steal this Google Business description (tested on 30+ remodelers)"

Body:
Copy this. Fill in the blanks. Paste it:

"[Company] specializes in [service] for [location] homeowners. [X] years, [X] projects, [rating]⭐. We handle [what you handle]. Licensed, insured, trusted. [Unique benefit]. [CTA]."

Example:
"Brooklyn Kitchen Co. specializes in brownstone kitchen renovations for Park Slope homeowners. 15 years, 200+ projects, 4.9⭐. We handle permits, design, and execution. Licensed, insured, trusted by NYC families. On-time, on-budget, guaranteed. Book your free estimate."

Takes 2 minutes. Boosts your visibility immediately.

---
Did it help? Tag a remodeler who needs this.
```

### PILLAR 3: AHA MOMENTS (20% of content)
**Goal:** Make the blindly obvious visible

**Friday Pattern Interrupt:**
```
Hook: "Your competitor with worse work gets more clients. Here's why:"

Body:
It's not their skills.
It's not their prices.
It's not their portfolio.

It's this:

When someone Googles "kitchen remodeler Brooklyn" — they show up.

You don't.

All your craftsmanship...
All those years of experience...  
All those 5-star reviews...

Invisible.

While you're on job sites building, your next $30K project is sitting in someone's Google search bar.

Question is: Are they finding YOU?

## OUTBOUND DM STRATEGY

### COLD OUTREACH TEMPLATE 1:
```
Hey [Name],

Saw your kitchen work in [Borough] - the [specific detail] looks incredible.

Quick question: When homeowners search "kitchen remodeler [borough]" are you in the top 3 results?

I ask because I help kitchen specialists rank #1 locally.

Recent example: [Client name] went from page 3 to #1 in 6 weeks. Now books 10-12 consultations monthly from Google alone.

If ranking matters to you, I'd love to share the exact strategy.

Either way - great work on [project detail].

- Manasseh
```

### COLD OUTREACH TEMPLATE 2:
```
[Name],

Noticed you specialize in [service] (smart niche btw).

Two questions:

1. Are you ranking for "[service] [area]"?
2. Is your site converting visitors into estimates?

Most specialists I talk to struggle with #2.

Their work is amazing, but their site doesn't clearly show:
- Timeline expectations
- Price ranges  
- What's included

So homeowners ghost them.

If that sounds familiar, I've got a simple fix.

Want to see it? [Calendar link]

- Manasseh
```

### FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE:

**Day 3 (if no response):**
```
[Name],

Not sure if you saw my last message, but wanted to share this resource:

[Link to lead magnet]

It's the exact framework we use to rank remodelers #1 in their borough.

No strings attached.

- M
```

**Day 7 (if still no response):**
```
[Name],

Last message from me (promise).

I ran a quick audit on your site and noticed 3 opportunities:

1. [Specific issue]
2. [Specific issue]  
3. [Specific issue]

Want the full breakdown? (Free - no obligation)

Just reply "YES" and I'll email it.

```

## CONVERSION CONTENT (WHEN THEY'RE WARM)

### BOOKING CALL POST:
```
Taking on 3 new remodeler clients this month.

After that, booked until March.

Here's what that looks like:

Week 1: Strategy call + site audit
Weeks 2-4: Design + build
Week 5: Launch + optimization  
Weeks 6-8: Leads start flowing

Timeline: 6-8 weeks
Your involvement: Minimal
Results: Measurable

If you're tired of websites that just sit there looking pretty while your competitors book jobs, let's talk.

[Calendar link]

P.S. This isn't for everyone. Only working with remodelers who:
- Do quality work (your portfolio speaks for itself)
- Want consistent leads (not just referrals)
- Are ready to invest in growth

If that's you, book a call.
```

### SCARCITY + VALUE POST:
```
Real talk: I turn down 70% of discovery calls.

Not because they're not good businesses.

Because they're not ready for what we do.

What we do:
Build websites that book 10+ calls/month

What we don't do:
Make "pretty" sites that win awards but generate zero revenue

If you're a remodeler who:
✓ Does $500K+ annually
✓ Has project photos to showcase  
✓ Wants predictable lead flow
✓ Is ready to invest $5K-$10K in growth

We should talk.

[Calendar link]

Everyone else: Save the free guides I post. Implement them yourself. Seriously.

They work. They just take time.

But if you want it done FOR you, and you're qualified, I've got 2 spots left this month.
```

---

## CRISIS MANAGEMENT

### IF A NEGATIVE COMMENT APPEARS:

**Don't:** Delete it (unless truly offensive)
**Don't:** Get defensive
**Don't:** Ignore it

**Do:** Respond calmly and professionally

**Template:**
```
"Hey [Name], appreciate the feedback. Can you share more about what you experienced? We're always looking to improve. Feel free to DM me directly if you'd prefer to discuss privately. - Manasseh"
```

### IF SOMEONE CALLS YOU OUT PUBLICLY:

**Step 1:** Take it to DMs immediately
**Step 2:** Address the concern privately  
**Step 3:** (If resolved) Post general response without naming them

```
"Had a great conversation today about [topic]. Reminder: we're human, we're learning, and we're always here to make things right. If you ever have concerns, my DMs are open."
```

---

## ADVANCED TACTICS

### COLLABORATION POSTS:
Partner with complementary businesses (interior designers, real estate agents) for co-created content

**Example:**
```
"I make websites for remodelers.
@[interior_designer] makes spaces beautiful.

Together we're helping [client] grow their business.

Here's what we learned about [topic]...

[Collaboration value]"
```

### TREND HIJACKING:
Use trending audio/topics but tie to remodeling

**Example (using trending audio):**
```
[Trending sound playing]

"POV: You're a remodeler who finally ranks #1 on Google"

[Show transformation of their business]
```

### CONTROVERSY (USED CAREFULLY):
Take a stand on industry debates

**Example:**
```
"Unpopular opinion: Most web designers are scamming remodelers.

They charge $10K+ for a site that:
• Looks pretty
• Loads slow
• Has no SEO
• Converts zero leads

Then ghost you after launch.

That's why we built Sora & Hue different.

[Explain your approach]"
```

## FINAL REMINDERS

**Don't overthink it.** Done > Perfect.

**Test everything.** What works for Logan might not work for you.

**Stay consistent.** Posting daily beats "going viral" once.

**Engage authentically.** Real relationships > vanity metrics.

**Track numbers.** What gets measured gets improved.

**Adjust quickly.** If it's not working, pivot.

Your competitors are moving. Don't let perfect be the enemy of profitable.

Start today. Post #1 this week. Book call #1 next month.
