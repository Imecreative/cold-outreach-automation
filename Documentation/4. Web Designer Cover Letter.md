Hiring Manager  
Coalition Technologies  
Remote Position

Dear Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Web Designer position at Coalition Technologies. With over four years of experience designing conversion-focused websites, comprehensive brand identities, and intuitive digital products, I'm confident I can contribute to your mission of delivering the highest quality work to clients while thriving in your innovative remote environment.

**Why I'm a Strong Fit**

Your job description resonated deeply with my experience and design philosophy. I have:

- **Mastery of core design tools:** I work daily in Figma for comprehensive design systems and prototyping, Adobe Photoshop for image editing and visual effects, and Adobe Illustrator for vector icon creation and brand identity work. These tools are the foundation of my workflow.

- **Understanding of web development constraints:** Having worked closely with developers throughout my career, I understand HTML/CSS principles and what's technically feasible. This knowledge allows me to design solutions that are both creative and implementable, reducing friction during hand-off.

- **Proven client-facing experience:** As Founder of Sora & Hue, I regularly present design concepts and strategic recommendations directly to clients. I've learned to articulate design decisions clearly, incorporate feedback gracefully, and build trust through transparent communication.

- **A strong portfolio demonstrating relevant expertise:** My portfolio showcases e-commerce and corporate website designs ([Verzo App](https://verzo-new-landing-page.vercel.app/), [MPD Group](https://mpdgrp.com/)), complete brand identities created from scratch, and web app dashboard designs—exactly what your role requires.

**What Excites Me About Coalition Technologies**

I'm particularly drawn to three aspects of this opportunity:

1. **Your collaborative, cross-functional approach:** I thrive when working with copywriters, SEO specialists, and developers to create cohesive solutions. At Verzo App, my closest collaboration with the development and marketing teams resulted in a website redesign that increased conversions by 35%.

2. **Your focus on quality and methodology:** I'm naturally detail-oriented and process-driven. When I delivered 25+ freelance projects with a 94% satisfaction rating, it was because I maintained rigorous quality standards and clear communication throughout.

3. **Your remote-first culture:** Having worked remotely for the past four years across multiple time zones, I've developed excellent async communication habits and time management skills. I'm fully available for the 9 AM – 6 PM PST schedule and have a professional remote setup with high-speed internet and quality equipment.

**How I Work Under Pressure**

At Hotels NG, I designed a complete mobile booking experience under a tight deadline, competing against 50+ other designers. My submission ranked at the top by focusing on clarity, prioritizing user needs, and maintaining pixel-perfect quality despite time constraints. I carry this same pressure-tested approach to every project.

**My Design Philosophy**

I believe great design tells a story—one that positions clients in a better light, inspires action, and drives measurable impact. This means balancing aesthetics with usability, creativity with accessibility, and innovation with business goals. Every design decision should have a strategic reason behind it.

I'm eager to bring my skills in wireframing, visual design, brand development, and client collaboration to Coalition Technologies. I'm confident that my combination of creative talent, technical understanding, and professional work ethic would make me a valuable addition to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to Coalition Technologies' continued success and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with your needs.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
